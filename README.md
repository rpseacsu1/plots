plotsJs
======

This is a javascript library for plotting math functions or data arrays very similar to the " plot " command found in Matlab or Scilab.

The main concept is very simple : just show the data on screen within a line graph.

You may pass it a data array of real numbers and this function shall plot the values on the screen through the HTML 5 Canvas.

Pros :

	- No need of other libraries
	- Simple and effective code

Cons :

	- Imaginary numbers not allowed

 TODO :
 
  	- Zoom

Examples :

	- 1 - Plots 10 random generated numbers
	- 2 -
