{"name":"Plotsjs","tagline":"Javascript library for plotting math functions or data arrays very similar to the \" plot \" command found in Matlab or Scilab.","body":"### Pros :\r\n- No need of other libraries\r\n- Simple and effective code\r\n- The snippet below works properly and is fully described in example_01.html\r\n\r\n```\r\nvar data = []\r\nfor(var k=0; k<10; k++) // randomly filled data array\r\n data.push(Math.random())\r\nplot(data,'canvasId') // this uses default options for colors, margins, etc; make it quick\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf you're a Matlab or Scilab user, you won't have trouble using this small library, because the concept is very simple : just show the data on screen.\r\n\r\n### More Examples\r\nThere are a few examples that you can download and run in a single file (only one html). They cover randomness, sound, image and electrical engineer subjects so as you to get in touch with library.\r\nUnfortunately, due to security issues, some codes cannot be run from local hard disk, but demand a server. Any XAMPP, Node.js, Joomla!, WebMatrix or whatever will let you run the code.\r\nPersonally, I find easier to run Node.js in Linux and WebMatrix in Windows, but that goes from person to person.\r\n\r\n### Sugestions\r\nI love hearing from others about my work. So feel free to give me sugestions and impressions over all examples.\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nYou can be part of this list... just take your time and add some new feature.\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nHaving trouble with this repo?
