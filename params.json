{"name":"Plotsjs","tagline":"Javascript library for plotting math functions or data arrays very similar to the 'plot' command found in Matlab or Scilab.","body":"### Elegance\r\n\r\nThe main concept is very simple : just show the values on the screen.\r\n\r\nJust like plotting a math function of real numbers.\r\n\r\n### Pros\r\n- No need of other libraries\r\n- Simple and effective code\r\n- The snippet below works properly and is fully described on Github\r\n\r\n```\r\nvar data = [ ]\r\nfor (var k = 0; k < 10; k++) // randomly filled data array\r\n data.push( Math.random() )\r\nplot (data, ' canvasId ' ) // this uses default options for colors, margins, etc\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf you're a Matlab(R) or Scilab user, you won't have trouble using this small library.\r\n\r\n\r\n### More Examples\r\n\r\nThere are a few examples that you can download and run in a single file (only one html). They cover randomness, sound, image and general electrical engineer subjects so as you to get in touch with the methods and properties.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, due to security issues, some codes cannot be run from local hard disk, but demand a server. Nevertheless, it will be clearly mentioned and any XAMPP, Node.js, Joomla!, Webmatrix or whatever will let you run the code.\r\n\r\nPersonally, I find it easier to run Node.js in Linux and Webmatrix in Windows.\r\n\r\n### Sugestions\r\n\r\nI love hearing from others about my work. So feel free to give me sugestions and impressions over all examples.\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\n\r\nYou can be part of this list... just take your time and add some new feature.\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\n\r\nHaving trouble with this repo? Contact mrutcha@gmail.com and weâ€™ll help you sort it out.\r\n\r\n### TODO list\r\n\r\nZoom will shortly be implemented","google":"UA-43798214-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
